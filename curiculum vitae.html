        <h3>Time management</h3>
        <p>Prioritizes essential tasks so
          they are not rushed. Sets
          deadlines that ensure reaching
          milestones on time.</p>

        <h3>Adaptability</h3>
        <p>I remember that change is not
          personal and is inevitable. I
          break my projects into multiple
          parts so that if something goes
          wrong, I can quickly fix it.</p>

        <h3>Accountability</h3>
        <p>I take ownership of my
          mistakes. By doing that I learn
          what I did wrong so that it does
          not happen again.</p>
